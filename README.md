# Welcome to the _new and fancy_ Java slides repo

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Write beautiful slides in markdown

This repo uses [marp](https://marp.app/). The VS Code extension for marp has nice build in preview.

The slides are automatically build and deployed on push to `main`.

When starting a new slide deck copy `slide.example.md` to the slides repo and use it as a template. Links on the index page are generated from `index.md`, remember to update it when adding new decks.
